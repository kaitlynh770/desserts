            This popular candy is called Dalgona (달고나). It was a poular street snack that was popular in the 1970s but is still eaten as a retro snack today. It's gained even more attention due to it's appearance in the massively popular show <i>Squid Game</i>. This candy only contains 2 ingredients: baking soda and sugar. When baking soda is added to the melted sugar, it makes the liquidized sugar puff up and become a light and airy candy when hardened. Dalgona is often poured onto a flat surface and pressed into a circular shape. Before it completely hardens, vendors use a variety of shapes to mold a cute pattern into the candy. With how simple it is to make, you could even make it right now at home if you wanted to!
