            Dango (団子) is a Japanese dumpling made from a mixture of primarily rice flour and glutinous rice flour. It's thought that the first dango ever created was at a tea house in Kyoto, Japan and named Kamo Mitarashi. The name of 'Dango' is thought to have been inspired by the bubbles made by the purifying water of <b>Mitarashi River.</b> Mitarashi Dango, a popular dango flavor, used to have 5 pieces on a stick, the top one representing the head, the next two the arms, and the last two the legs.

            While Dango can be eaten casually as a snack, they're also used for a variety of traditional holidays. One holiday is the <b>Mitarashi Festival</b> held at the Shimogamo Shrine. Dango are often brought as the main offerings to this festival and often come in three colors: red, green, and white.
