            Honey Toast (ハニートースト) is a Japanese dessert that originated from Shibuya. It's often sold in karaoke and bars and is most commonly shared among friends. This dessert is also quite popular in Taiwan and Singapore. The dessert is prepared by hollowing out the toast and cutting it into smaller cubes. Both the cubes and the loaf are then carmeralized with butter and honey, and then put in a toaster oven once again to bake. Once finished, the cubes are put back in the hollowed shell and a variety of toppings are put on top of it. Toppings often include fruits, syrups, toasted nuts, cookies, and whip cream. To top it off, an ice cream scoop is placed on top. This is the perfect dessert to make on your own and share with friends!
