            Egg tarts, called 'Dan-Tat'(蛋撻) in Cantonese, is a dessert that contains a flaky outer crust with egg custard in the middle. These tarts are often small, able to fit in the palm of your hand. Dan tats were introduced to Hong Kong via Guangzhou in the 1940s. Initially, they were only found in higher-end Western restaurants, but evetually made its way to <i>cha chaa tengs</i>(茶餐廳) over the years. They're often sold in groups of 2-3 and come in a variety of fillings. Much like Pineapple Buns, these egg tarts are considered a staple in Hong Kong culture.
