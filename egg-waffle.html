            <i>Egg waffles</i> (雞蛋仔, pronounced gai dan zaai) are a popular treat in Macau and Hong Kong. The name in Cantonese literally translates to 'little chicken egg', the origins of which are unknown. There are many stories that may explain where the name came from, with one being that it's the egg shape acted as a sort of substitute for eggs since they were considered a luxury. In another few stories, bakers would purchase damaged eggs and attempt to work them into a batter. In contrast to normal European waffles, a special mold is used to create Egg Waffles to produce the iconic bubbly look. The trick to getting the crispy texture is to turn the pan over quickly after the batter is poured in. While the taste is considered quite 'eggy', there a variety of flavors that have been incorporated into this snack for every person to enjoy.
