            Daifuku (大福, literally means 'Great Luck') is a popular wagashi (Japanese confection) that is often a small mochi filled with sweet filling (mainly anko, which is a sweetened red bean paste). They were origially called Habutai mochi (腹太餅, means belly thick rice cake) because of the filling. The name was later changed to <i>Daifuku Mochi</i> (大腹餅), because the word 'fuku', mean both belly and luck. People thought that this dessert would bring them luck, thus why the name was changed to Daifuku (大福餅 = great luck rice cake). This treat is often served with green tea, and comes in many varieties (like many of the other desserts listed here). It comes in different colors, the most common being white, pink and green. They're coated with a layer of potato starch or corn starch to prevent sticking.
