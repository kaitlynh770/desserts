            Bingsoo (빙수) is Korean shaved ice that consists of an ice base with various toppings. The most common variation that was widely eaten in the past is called Patbingsoo (팥빙수), which means Red Bean Shaved Ice. This version included 3 main ingredients:

        <ul id = "list">
            <li>
                Red bean paste
            </li>
            <li>
                Tteok (rice cake)
            </li>
            <li>
                Ground nut pattern
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "center-paragraph" id = "paragraph2">
            The earliest instance this dessert was eaten was during the Joseon Dynasty (1392 - 1937). Many elders claim that this dessert gained popularity after the Korean war, as the supplies that were left over would be used for experimenting with different toppings for this cold dessert. Patbingsu is considered the oldest and most traditional version of bingsoo, but overtime there have been many new and popular flavors that have taken the spotlight. This cold dessert also has its own variations in different countries, such as in Singapore and Japan.
